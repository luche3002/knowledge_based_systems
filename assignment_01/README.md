# Assignment:
`Build a Knowledge-Based System for an Online Shopping Assistant`

## Objective:
Create a knowledge-based system (KBS) that helps users choose products based on their preferences. The assistant will suggest products based on various criteria such as category, price range, and features.

1. `Create a Knowledge Engine:`
   * Use a Python-based expert system library (such as experta) to build the Knowledge Engine.
   * Define facts about available products in the system (e.g., product category, price range, and key features).
   * Create rules to infer product recommendations based on user inputs.

2. `Define Facts and Rules:`
   * Create facts about the products such as category (e.g., electronics, clothing), price range (e.g., low, medium, high), and features (e.g., waterproof, battery life).
   * Define at least 3 products with different features (e.g., a smartphone, a laptop, a jacket).
   * Create rules to recommend a product based on the userâ€™s preferences (e.g., recommend a laptop if the user wants a product with a medium price range and long battery life).

3. `Interaction with the User:`
   * The assistant should ask the user for their preferences (e.g., "What is your price range?").
   * Once the user has provided their preferences, the system should output a product recommendation based on the rules and facts.

4. `Example Interaction:`
   * Question 1: What is your preferred price range? (e.g., low, medium, high)
   * Question 2: What category are you looking for? (e.g., electronics, clothing)
   * Question 3: What features are important to you? (e.g., waterproof, battery life)
   * Based on the input, the assistant should suggest an appropriate product.

5. `Bonus Challenge:`
   * Add more features like "brand" or "color" to refine the recommendations.
   * Implement the option for users to ask for multiple product recommendations based on different preferences (e.g., "show me products in the electronics category").
